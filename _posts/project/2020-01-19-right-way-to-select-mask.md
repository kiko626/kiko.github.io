N95 medical masks, the preferred protecting from china coronavirus, have been out of stock in spite of the prices reaching $2.2 a mask until 19 January.

There is little possibility to buy N95 masks with Taobao.com during lunar new year, but there are several tips you can follow in order to help you select those available rightly.

## Medical protective masks > Medical surgical masks > General medical masks

+ Medical protective masks include N95 and N99, both two are the best choices because they can block at least 95 or even 99 percent of very small (0.3 micron) particles that may contain virus and bacterial.

+ Medical surgical mask is another cheaper alternative, to some extent, it also works.

+ But general medical mask is NOT recommended to be used.
